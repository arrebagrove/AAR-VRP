# Introduction

AAR (https://aar.pausd.org/) is an advanced academic research class in Palo Alto Unified School District.  It is a unique opportunity for students in grades 10-12 to engage in original research in an area of their choice.

In 2016-2017 school year, I had the opportunity to work with Dr Kai Zhu on studying the Vehicle Routing Problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem).  VRP studies the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse in order to deliver to a given set of customers.  Determiming the optimal solution is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization.  In this study we designed and simulated several algorithms for a taxi dispatching problem.  Although the optimal solution will be in exponential space, we proposed a solution which is close to optimal but only consumes limited resources.
